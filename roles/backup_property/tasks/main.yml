# This role is being used by multiple properties.
# It creates a local backup directory and makes a backup of the root folder using Restic.
# After the compressed data us backed up to S3, it gets removed from the system again.
# Backup logs can be found at /local/systems/backup.log
# The {{ property }} var has to match the bucket's folder.

# Example usage:
# - name: Run backup tasks
#   include_role:
#     name: backup_property
#   vars:
#     property: property-name
#     backup_path: "{{ property_document_root_path }}"

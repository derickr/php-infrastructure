# Ansible for PHP with STA project

## Proposal

We created this project as a shadow infra for [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) to automate server infrastructure setup.

Ansible is a configuration management tool that facilitates the task of setting up and maintaining remote servers.
Ansible doesnâ€™t require any special software to be installed on the nodes that will be managed with this tool.
A control machine is set up with the Ansible software, which then communicates with the nodes via standard SSH.

[Here are some tips for making the most of Ansible and Ansible playbooks.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#best-practices)

## Using Ansible

Ansible organises system administration operations into a hierarchy of playbooks containing roles containing tasks.

To run any playbook, we first have to establish an SSH connection to one of the jumphosts:

```shell
bin/auth-jump0
```

This creates an SSH control channel to jumphost0 that will remain valid for 4 hours. Re-run this when connections start failing after 4 hours.

There is a corresponding `bin/auth-jump1`.

Then you can run any playbook like this:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

If you have more than one inventory (say one to try things out with and a live one), you can overwrite the default inventory of `inventory/php` (set in `ansible.cfg`) like so: `ansible-playbook -i inventory/other ...`

## Prerequisites

1. Create vault password 
2. Create admins.yml file with GA files and pubkeys

## Initialize machines

To initialize your machines, run this playbook:

```sh
ansible-playbook initialize.yml --extra-vars "@/path/to/admins.yml"
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to pass a file with all admins you want to add.
> The format looks like this, but there is also an example at `etc/admins.yml`:
>

```yml
admins:
  - name: rocko
    GA_file: /home/rocko/.google_authenticator
    pubkeys:
      - ssh-rsa abcxyz rocko.artischocko@mail.com
      - ssh-ed25519 abcxyz artischocko@rocko.ie
```

You can add several publick keys, but you don't have to.

### What this does

Initialise _all_ machines. This means: jumphosts, services where the properties live on and the rsync machine.

  1. Define all admin users (name, pubkey, Google Authenticator file)
  2. Disable root login
  3. Google Auth set up
  4. Set up firewall rules to only log in via jump host IPs


## Set up services

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you run this, you should modify the domain names at `inventory/php/group_vars/service.yml`
>

If you wanna read more about the services, please do so at our [Properties readme](Properties.md).
To set them up, run:

- rsync: `ansible-playbook initRsync.yml`
- downloads: `ansible-playbook initServiceDownloads.yml`
- wiki: `ansible-playbook initServiceWiki.yml`
- museum: `ansible-playbook initServiceMuseum.yml`
- main: `ansible-playbook initServiceMain.yml`

Now you are ready to go! :tada:

# Additional tasks

## Using encrypted vars

Edit the all.yml file:

```shell
EDITOR=nano ansible-vault edit inventory/php/group_vars/all.yml
```

You will be prompted for your vault password.

Further details on encryption can be found in [ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault_encrypting_content.html).


## Changing the Jumphost

By default, jumphost0 is used, to change this, you have to copy your `ansible.cfg` to `local.ansible.cfg` (which is .gitignored) and set the shell environment variable `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` to `local.ansible.cfg`. Then you change this line in `local.ansible.cfg`:

```diff
-ssh_common_args = -F etc/ssh_config_jump0
+ssh_common_args = -F etc/ssh_config_jump1
```

And then you initialise the authentication with `bin/auth-jump1` like before.

## Using different jumphosts

You can specify different hosts that you want to run your playbook on.
Currently we have two jumphosts set up: one in Europe (ams3) and one in North America (nyc1).
By default the host is set to the jumphost in Europe (ams3).

To change jumphost to a different one use the `--extra-vars` argument as follows:

```shell
ansible-playbook [Add playbook yml file] --extra-vars "host=[ADD HOST e.g. nyc1]"
```
